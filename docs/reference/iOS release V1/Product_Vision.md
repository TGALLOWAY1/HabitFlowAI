# 1. Product Vision Statement (One Page)

### HabitFlow iOS — Vision

**HabitFlow iOS is a calm, non-punitive daily companion that helps users record what they actually did—without judgment, gamification pressure, or false certainty.**

The app exists to make **logging real behavior frictionless**, while keeping **meaning, motivation, and interpretation optional and reversible**.

At launch, HabitFlow iOS will:

* Let users **log habits confidently** (binary or numeric)
* Make **editing and correcting history safe**
* Surface **derived insights** without storing or asserting them as truth
* Preserve **psychological safety** by avoiding failure states, overdue warnings, or streak pressure

HabitFlow iOS will **not** attempt to:

* Coach aggressively
* Predict outcomes
* Enforce schedules
* Replace reflection with automation
* Invent progress where no entry exists

This app is intentionally minimal—not because it lacks ambition, but because **truth comes before insight**.

> If the app crashes, syncs late, or loses derived state, *nothing important is lost*—because truth lives in entries.

### Design Principles (Launch-Defining)

1. **Entry > Everything**

   * If none of the 3 'entry' elements [HabitEntry, JournalEntry, WellbeingEntry]exists, nothing happened.

2. **Derived, Never Stored**
   * Completion, streaks, progress, momentum are views—not state.

3. **Non-Punitive by Default**
   * Missed days are neutral.

4. **Editability Is a Feature**
   * History is correctable without shame.

5. **Offline-Safe Truth**
   * Logging works anywhere; meaning reconciles later.
