Future work may include:
- filtering journals by habit or goal
- cross-object insights

These are non-blocking and not required for V1.

# Revisit this in the metrics.md (rolling vs calendar week)
All weekly and momentum metrics use rolling windows by default.
Calendar-aligned weeks are not used unless explicitly added in the future.
