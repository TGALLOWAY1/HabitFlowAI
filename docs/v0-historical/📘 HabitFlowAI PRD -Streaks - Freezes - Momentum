# 📘 PRD — HabitFlow: Momentum, Streaks, Freezes, Weekly Logic & Goal Alignment

## Status

**Approved for implementation**

---

## 1. Purpose & Philosophy

HabitFlow is designed to help users build consistency **without triggering all-or-nothing thinking**.
This PRD formalizes systems that:

* Reward engagement over perfection
* Treat missed days as pauses, not failures
* Encourage long-term identity change, not short-term compliance
* Keep the dashboard emotionally safe and cognitively light

Key design stance:

> **Momentum > purity. Engagement > streak anxiety. Progress > pressure.**

---

## 2. Core Concepts (Definitions)

### 2.1 Habit

A recurring behavior tracked either:

* **Daily**, or
* **Weekly (quota-based)**

Each habit belongs to exactly **one category** (e.g. Fitness, Learning).

---

### 2.2 Category

A high-level life domain grouping habits.
Categories are used for:

* Identity framing
* Category-level momentum feedback

---

### 2.3 Momentum

A **descriptive indicator of recent engagement**, not a score.

Momentum exists at two levels:

1. **Global Momentum** — life-level
2. **Category Momentum** — domain-level

Momentum never penalizes, never breaks streaks, and never regresses progress.

---

### 2.4 Streak

A measure of **continued engagement** with a habit.

* Daily habits → streak measured in days
* Weekly habits → streak measured in weeks

Streaks are protected by **freeze mechanics** and **grace rules**.

---

### 2.5 Freeze

A freeze protects a habit’s streak during a missed day/week.

Freezes are:

* Limited
* Intentional
* Supportive (never framed as failure prevention)

---

## 3. Dashboard UX (High-Level, Reference Only)

The dashboard shows **no habit-level analytics**.

### Dashboard displays:

1. **Global Momentum Indicator** (single line of copy)
2. **Today**

   * Habits completed: X
   * Habits remaining: Y
3. **Optional Focus Habits**

   * User-selected
   * Checkbox + streak only

### Dashboard explicitly does NOT show:

* Consistency %
* Per-habit history
* Per-habit momentum
* Failure states

---

## 4. Momentum System (Final)

### 4.1 Global Momentum

**Question answered:**

> “Am I generally keeping my life together right now?”

#### Logic

* Rolling **7-day window**
* A day counts if **at least one habit** (daily or weekly) is completed

#### States

| Days Active (last 7) | State          |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| 6–7                  | Strong         |
| 4–5                  | Steady         |
| 2–3                  | Building       |
| 1                    | Gentle Restart |
| 0                    | Ready          |

#### Copy (rotated, non-repeating)

Each state has a phrase pool (examples):

**Strong**

* “You’re in a great rhythm”
* “Momentum is strong right now”

**Steady**

* “You’ve got solid momentum”
* “Nice follow-through this week”

**Building**

* “Momentum is building”
* “You’re getting back into motion”

**Gentle Restart**

* “Welcome back”
* “One step is enough to restart”

**Ready**

* “Ready when you are”
* “No pressure — start anytime”

---

### 4.2 Category Momentum

**Question answered:**

> “Am I showing up in this area of my life?”

#### Logic

* Rolling **7-day window**
* A day counts if **any habit in that category** is completed

| Days Active | State    |
| ----------- | -------- |
| 5–7         | Strong   |
| 3–4         | Steady   |
| 1–2         | Building |
| 0           | Paused   |

#### Category Momentum Copy (examples)

**Strong**

* “Fitness momentum is strong”
* “This area is well supported right now”

**Steady**

* “Momentum is holding here”
* “You’re staying engaged”

**Building**

* “Momentum is starting to build”
* “A few steps in the right direction”

**Paused**

* “This area has been quiet”
* “Ready when you want to restart”

📌 Category momentum is **informational only** and never affects streaks.

---

## 5. Freeze System

### 5.1 Freeze Inventory Rules

* Max freezes: **3**
* Earn rate: **1 freeze per 7 days of any activity**
* Cap enforced (cannot exceed 3)
* Freezes are **per habit**, not global

---

### 5.2 Freeze Types

#### Type A — Manual Freeze (Explicit)

User action: *“Skip today → Protect my streak”*

**Behavior**

* Streak preserved
* No completion recorded
* Momentum unaffected
* Freeze count −1

**Copy**

* “Streak protected”
* “Pick this back up tomorrow”

---

#### Type B — Soft Freeze (Grace / No-Penalty)

Automatically applied when:

* Habit streak ≥ 3
* Category momentum is **Strong or Steady**
* User misses a day
* No manual freeze used

**Behavior**

* Streak preserved
* No freeze consumed
* Habit marked as “paused”

**UI Helper Copy**

* “Paused — resume tomorrow to keep streak”

This teaches:

> Short pauses are part of consistency.

---

### 5.3 When Streaks Actually Break

A streak breaks only if:

* A day/week is missed
* AND no soft freeze applies
* AND no manual freeze is used

Streak loss should be **rare, predictable, and non-traumatic**.

---

## 6. Daily Habits

### Completion Rules

* Checkbox per day
* Counts toward:

  * Habit streak
  * Category momentum
  * Global momentum
  * Linked goals

### Missed Day Behavior

* Freeze logic applies
* No negative feedback shown

---

## 7. Weekly Habits (Quota-Based)

### Example

**“Go to the gym 3× per week”**

### Tracking Model

Each week stores:

* Target (e.g. 3)
* Actual completions (0–N)
* Completion state: Partial / Complete

---

### Weekly Streak Rules

| Actual       | Outcome                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| ≥ Target     | Full completion → streak continues            |
| 1–(Target−1) | Partial completion → streak continues         |
| 0            | Missed week → streak pauses or freeze applies |

### Key Principle

> Weekly streaks represent **continued engagement**, not perfect execution.

---

### Weekly Copy

**Full**

* “Week complete — nice follow-through”

**Partial**

* “Partial week — still counts”
* “You showed up this week”

**Missed**

* “This week was skipped”
* “Pick it back up next week”

---

### “Shifted the Day” (Weekly Flexibility)

If a user planned a day but completes on a different day:

* Week still counts
* Streak continues
* Optional micro-copy:

  * “Nice adjustment — flexibility counts”

No penalties. No lateness concept.

---

## 8. Habits Page UX Rules (Current Scope)

### Habits Page shows:

* Habit cards
* Checkbox (daily/weekly)
* Streak count
* Freeze availability indicator
* Category momentum header

### Habits Page does NOT include (for now):

* Long history views
* Heatmaps
* Consistency %

(Current 2-week checkbox view remains.)

---

## 9. Goals Alignment

### Goal Philosophy

> Goals reflect **directional progress**, not daily compliance.

### Goal Progress Interpretation

Instead of raw % alone, show **interpreted state**:

| Recent Pattern          | Goal Copy                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Regular activity        | “Progress is moving steadily”         |
| Inconsistent but active | “Still on track — progress compounds” |
| No recent activity      | “Paused for now — no rush”            |

### Rules

* Goals **never regress**
* Goals pause, they do not fail
* Habit misses do not create negative goal feedback

---

## 10. Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

* Per-habit momentum states
* Punitive streak loss
* Red/green failure UI
* Habit history beyond 2 weeks (future consideration)
* Goal penalties for missed habits

---

## 11. Success Criteria

This system is successful if:

* Users do not abandon habits after missed days
* Streak loss feels rare and understandable
* Dashboard feels calm, not demanding
* Users re-engage after pauses instead of quitting
* Language consistently reinforces resilience

---

## 12. Future Extensions (Not Implemented Yet)

* Longer habit history views
* Momentum trends over months
* Goal-level momentum
* Analytics surfaces (opt-in)
