# V1 Product Direction

## Positioning

HabitFlow v1 is personal-use-first and optimized for practical execution.

Primary emphasis:
- fast logging
- accurate derived progress
- clear visual insight

## Explicit Direction Change

v1 is not optimizing for maximum psychological-safety framing.

Still true:
- canonical truth invariants remain mandatory
- no fake/stored completion truth
- no derived metrics persisted as behavioral truth

## Canonical Guardrails (Unchanged)

- HabitEntry is sole behavioral truth.
- Completion/progress/streaks/momentum are derived.
- DayKey is aggregation boundary.
- Routines and journals do not imply habit completion.

## v1 Success Criteria

1. Fast logging loop
- low-friction habit entry creation/update/delete
- stable DayKey handling across timezone boundaries

2. Clear progress visibility
- trustworthy weekly/monthly summaries derived from entries
- zero hidden/parallel truth stores

3. Rich analytics dashboards
- high-density read-only insights
- actionable category/habit trends without mutating truth

## Deferred/Preserved Direction

Psychological-safety-first direction is preserved for future exploration:
