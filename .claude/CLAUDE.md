# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

HabitFlowAI is a full-stack habit-tracking web app — TypeScript monorepo (ESM, `"type": "module"`) with React 19 + Vite frontend and Express 5 backend, backed by MongoDB. Tracks habits, routines, goals, journal entries, wellbeing, and tasks.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev            # Start frontend (port 5176) + backend (port 3001) concurrently
npm run dev:vite       # Frontend only
npm run dev:server     # Backend only
npm run build          # TypeScript typecheck (tsc -b) + Vite build
npm run lint           # ESLint full project
npm run lint:beta      # ESLint server/shared/domain only (CI scope)
npm run test           # Vitest in watch mode
npm run test:run       # Vitest single run (all tests)
npm run test:beta      # CI beta test suite (critical subset)
npm run verify         # Full validation script
```

### Running a single test

```bash
npx vitest run path/to/file.test.ts          # Run one test file
npx vitest run --testNamePattern "pattern"    # Run tests matching name pattern
npx vitest run src/server/routes/__tests__/   # Run all tests in a directory
```

## Architecture

### Key Invariant: Entries Are Truth

**`habitEntries` is the single source of truth.** All derived views (day view, progress, streaks, goal progress) are computed from entries at read time — never stored. If you need to add a new metric or view, derive it from entries, don't create a new collection.

**Removed collections** (do NOT reference): `dayLogs`, `goalManualLogs`.

| Domain | Collection | Role |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Behavioral | `habitEntries` | **Canonical truth** — all derived views computed from this |
| Reflective | `journalEntries` | Journal entries |
| Wellbeing | `wellbeingEntries` | Canonical wellbeing truth (replaces legacy `wellbeingLogs`) |
| Derived (not stored) | — | Day view, day summary, progress, streaks, goal progress |

```

### Frontend Architecture

- **Routing:** Query-string based (`?view=...`) via `src/App.tsx`, plus path-based for dedicated pages
- **State:** React Context — `HabitContext`, `AuthContext`, `RoutineContext`, `TaskContext`
- **API Client:** `src/lib/persistenceClient.ts`
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3 with dynamic color safe-list
- **Dev proxy:** Vite forwards `/api` requests to `http://localhost:3001`

### Shared & Domain Layers

- **`src/shared/`** — Code used by both frontend and backend: persona definitions, persona invariants, demo config
- **`src/domain/`** — Domain primitives (e.g., `domain/time/` for timezone/DayKey utilities)

### Identity Model

Every API request requires `X-Household-Id` and `X-User-Id` headers. In dev/test, bootstrap defaults are used when headers are missing. In production, missing headers = 401. All data access is scoped by userId.

Middleware: `src/server/middleware/identity.ts`

### DayKey Policy

DayKey = `YYYY-MM-DD`, computed in a timezone (not UTC). Server uses client's IANA timezone if valid, falls back to **America/New_York**. DayKey is the aggregation boundary for all date-based queries.

Server authority: `src/server/utils/dayKey.ts` and `src/server/utils/dayKeyNormalization.ts`

### Canonical Data Flow

1. User action -> Frontend writes `HabitEntry` via `/api/entries`
2. Backend validates dayKey/timezone, forbids stored-completion fields
3. Derived views computed from entries at read time
4. Soft-delete pattern: `deletedAt` timestamp (not hard delete)

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions (`ci-beta.yml`) on push/PR to main:
1. `npm ci` (Node 20)
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run test:beta`
4. `npm run lint:beta`

Deployment: Render (backend via `render.yaml`) + Vercel (frontend via `vercel.json`).

## Testing

- **Vitest** + JSDOM (frontend) + Supertest (API)
- **mongodb-memory-server** by default — tests don't touch real DB
- Live DB testing: set `ALLOW_LIVE_DB_TESTS=true` with DB name containing `_test`
- Test helpers: `src/test/mongoTestHelper.ts`, `src/test/assertTestDb.ts`
- Setup file: `src/test/setup.ts`

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode (`noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters` enabled), ESLint 9 flat config
- **Beta gate** (CI-enforced on `src/server/`, `src/shared/`, `src/domain/`, excludes `__tests__/`): `no-unused-vars` is error (except `_`-prefixed), `no-explicit-any` is warning
- Unused variables/parameters: prefix with `_`
- Soft deletes via `deletedAt` field — never hard delete truth records

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Minimal code impact.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary.

## Documentation

Full documentation index at `docs/DOC_INDEX.md`. Key references:
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — System design, identity, DayKey, truth ownership
- `docs/DOMAIN_CANON.md` — Minimal invariants & canonical references
- `docs/API.md` — REST endpoint inventory
- `docs/DATA_MODEL.md` — Collections & ownership boundaries

## Workflow

- Enter plan mode for non-trivial tasks (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- Use subagents for research, exploration, and parallel analysis
- After corrections from user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Track work in `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
- Never mark a task complete without verifying it works (run tests, check logs)
